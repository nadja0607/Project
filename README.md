# Project - Ballonland
Developing a simple interactive game "Balloonland".
The main purpose of our project is to engage interaction between children in a fun and interesting way. 
The children would be engaged to play with at least one more child. The game specifically targets children aged 3-11, hence its simple graphics and interface. By having a simple background, including grass and trees, and simple targets as balloons, children would be able toeasily undrestand the game and its purpose. 
The game has 2 players, a boy and a girl, and their targets are balloons in 2 colors, red and blue. 
Their task is to pop as many balloons as possible, which stimulates childrenâ€™s competitive spirit. 
The only rule of this game is that the girl can only pop the red balloons and the boy can only pop the blue ones.
There is a counter which tracks how many balloons each player has popped.
Once one of the players pops his/her balloons, the game ends.
